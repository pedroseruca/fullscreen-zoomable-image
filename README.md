# Zoomable Image

This package gives you fullscreen content viewer, that allows you to zoom in using pinch gesture. Once the gesture is over the content gets to the original position.

It brings a blured fullscreen content background, with some horizontal parallax effect.

To close this SwiftUI component, you can either tap on the cross icon, tap on the background or swipe the image quickly to the top or bottom.
